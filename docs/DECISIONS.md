## 2026-06-15: Use Repo Files For Agent Communication

Decision:

- Codex and Claude Code communicate through versioned repo files, especially `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

Reason:

- Agents cannot directly DM each other.
- Repo-based communication is auditable, persistent, and works across tools.

## 2026-06-15: Treat Hardened Interpreter As Runtime Core

Decision:

- The canonical runtime is `jargon_interpreter.py`.
- Legacy Colab/web interpreter files remain reference material, not active runtime code.

Reason:

- The hardened interpreter has resource limits, bounded AST evaluation, tests, and sandbox support.

## 2026-06-15: Keep Mentor Separate From Runtime

Decision:

- The AI mentor/chat layer should call or explain the runtime, not replace it.

Reason:

- Execution must be deterministic and testable.
- Teaching behavior can evolve without changing core language semantics.

## 2026-06-15: Preserve Stable Result Shape

Decision:

- Runtime calls return the same core fields: `output`, `memory`, `errors`, `ask`, `ask_var`, `status`, `truncated`, and `limits_hit`.

Reason:

- Older web experiments drifted between `input`/`code` and `result`/`output`; the rebuild needs one contract.
